Pings responded:This rule checks if ping requests receive a response or not. It is designed to test a protocol rule on a udp packet

403 Forbidden Stream: This rule checks if the host is trying
to access pages it does not have permissions to by checking the responses from a webserver with the 403 code.
It is designed to test the stream rules and the tcp reconstruction since the forbidden message could be wrapped in
different packets. The '403 forbidden' is a test for the correctness of protocol rules by matching the text
in a single packet whereas the stream rule applies the reconstruction and matches against all the packets in the trace.

404 Not Found: This rule checks if the host is trying
to access pages that do not exist by checking the responses from a webserver with the 404 code.
It is designed to test the stream rules and the tcp reconstruction since the 404 message could be contained in
different packets.It also tests matching of flags in sequence; the 404 reverse rules tests that it does not flag the packets if the flags
are not in order.

Welcome : A test rule that checks for the string 'welcome!' in a page. It is designed to test the protocol rule on a tcp packet.
test with trace_s1.pcap

Page Request : This rule is designed to test a protocol rule with flags and to also test when packets are being sent, since the rest of the test cases
have been implemented for when the host is on the receiving end.
